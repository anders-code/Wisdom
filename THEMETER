"Six Simple rules to follow when raising kids.
Rule #1:     Don't take yourself seriously.
   You are not responsible for taking care of your kids.  They are responsible for themselves from the beginning.
   You are only a tool that they can use to take care of themselves.
   As infants they learn when the best times are to cry for attention and when it is better to sleep.
   Later they learn to manipulate you to provide them with whatever they need 
   until they learn to use better tools such as money and political alliances.
Rule #2:     Take yourself seriously.
   You may be just a tool, but you are still the boss.   
   Tools must be used properly and it is up to you to not allow yourself to be used improperly.
Rule #3:     Always be consistent.
   Any tool must be consistent and predictable to be useful.  If it isn’t, you can never be confident of future results.
Rule #4:     Don't worry about being consistent.
   Although you should always try to be consistent, life never is and the child must learn to deal with it.    
   If you notice you are being very successful, zing them once in a while just to keep them on their toes.
Rule #5:     Don't use corporal punishment for control.
   Corporal punishment teaches the wrong lesson.  It encourages a child to overpower problems instead of solving them.
Rule #6:     Always win power struggles.
   When there is a power struggle you can cheat or beat or whatever it takes to win.   
   After you win; realize that you made a mistake or the power struggle would have never occurred.   
   Figure out what the mistake was and correct it so it never happens again.

"A word is a word and a thought is a thought.
